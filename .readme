# Library Management System

A comprehensive Library Management System built with Spring Boot, MySQL, and JWT authentication.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization with JWT

## Database Design

The system uses a relational database with the following main tables:

- `books` - Contains book metadata with support for multiple authors
- `authors` - Author information
- `categories` - Book categories with hierarchical support
- `publishers` - Publisher information
- `borrowing_records` - Tracks book borrowing transactions
- `user_activities` - Logs user activities for auditing

## Setup Instructions

1. Create MySQL database named `library_management`
2. Update `application.properties` with your database credentials
3. Run the application using Spring Boot
4. The database schema will be automatically created
5. Sample data will be inserted automatically

## Default Admin Account

- Username: admin
- Password: admin123 (change after first login)

## Security

The system uses JWT for authentication with the following roles:
- ADMIN: Full system access

All passwords are encrypted using BCrypt password encoder.
